# 🌸 HTML & CSS Showcase

A curated collection of **HTML and CSS mini projects** built to strengthen core frontend development skills through hands-on practice.

---

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains a series of **beginner-friendly, focused exercises** designed to build a strong foundation in **HTML structure**, **CSS styling**, and **layout fundamentals**.
Each folder includes an independent mini project demonstrating specific concepts and techniques.

The main goal of this repository is **learning by doing** — exploring HTML and CSS features through small, practical builds rather than full-scale responsive websites.
