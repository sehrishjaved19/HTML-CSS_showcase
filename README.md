# HTML-CSS_showcase

A collection of **HTML and CSS practice projects** created to strengthen foundational web development skills.

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains **small, hands-on exercises** designed to reinforce understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling.
Each folder includes an independent script or mini-project, allowing for focused practice of specific concepts and techniques.

The primary goal of this repository is **learning through practice**, rather than creating full-fledged projects or responsive layouts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a separate practice project or concept, for example:

* `Addmission_From/` → A practice form exploring different input types and form elements.
* `UI_Card/` → A simple card layout to experiment with styling and box properties.
* `solar_system/` → A creative exercise testing positioning and background styling.

To view any example, open the corresponding `.html` file in a web browser. Each project runs independently.
